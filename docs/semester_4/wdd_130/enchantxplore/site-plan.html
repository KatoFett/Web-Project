        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>When playing Minecraft, have you ever gotten an enchanted book and asked,” Wait. What does this do again”? Or
            have you
            ever wished there was a personalized guide to show you which enchantments are the best for your armor? I
            want to put
            together a website that does just that. It has every enchantment right at your fingertips. It’ll also tell
            you exactly
            what the enchantment does, and which enchantments it’s incompatible with, if any. Then, I plan on making a
            personalized
            guide for enchanting your gear – whether it’s your newfangled netherite helmet, or that fancy trident you
            nearly died
            acquiring. This website will be free, open access, and interactive.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The intended audience is any Minecraft players of any skill level. The site should be easy enough for new
            players who know nothing about enchanting to be able to be guided around and discover how enchanting works.
            At the same time, it should be fast enough so that expert players who are looking for information should be
            able to find exactly what they need promptly.</p> <!-- change this -->

            Content
        </h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>The website will first display all the different gear types in a list. This is because that the most often
            scenario for searching through enchantments is to find ones that match a certain type of gear. An example of
            this is when you obtain a new weapon, say a diamond sword, and you want to see which enchantments will
            provide the most benefit for your sword. When that player goes to the website, the workflow will be that
            they find and click on the Swords category and see all of its enchantments. The category will be easy to
            find because each category will have its own associated image that will naturally match what the user is
            looking for.
            <br />
            <br />
            There may also be a list for all the different enchantments, and a search bar to filter the list.

        <em>An example category image</em>
        </ul>
        <h3>Category</h3>
        <p>After the user finds the category they are looking for, they will be directed to another page which will
            display the enchantments for that category. The list will probably be in alphabetical order to best assist
            the user in finding specific enchantments. The enchantments will also have a brief description or summary by
            their name. There will be minimal information to show in this page because there’s not much to gear
            categories other than which enchantment apply to them. </p>

        <img src="images/category_chest.png" alt="image for homepage">
        <em>An example category image. Image will vary based on the selected category. There is one unique image per category.</em>

        </ul>
        <h3>Enchantment</h3>
        <p>
            The user may then click on an enchantment in the categories page. They will be directed to a new page which
            will have detailed information about it. The page will display an extended summary of the enchantment as
            well as all gear categories to which the enchantment may apply. Other special information such as
            enchantment exclusions (the presence of such enchantments on a weapon will prevent that enchantment from
            being applied), maximum level, and other specific details will also be displayed. From this page, the user
            will be able to navigate to other related enchantments and relevant gear categories. </p>
